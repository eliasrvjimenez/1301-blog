 <p>I am not a writer. At least, not at heart.  Down to the bone, I have always been a more logic-oriented person, and creativity was never a strong suit of mine.  Sure, I may be able to type quickly, and can type pages upon pages in less than an hour, but that, to me, does not constitute a writer. Writers are people with the passion and creativity to create beautiful works, filled to the brim with words that drive the reader to visualize whatever it is they have read, and visualize it well.  Writers can create worlds from nothing, sprawling their ideas onto the page with ease. That is something that I cannot do.

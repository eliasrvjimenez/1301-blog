            <hr />
            <p className="dateSub"> <em> November 30th, 2022 </em> </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; When it comes to the lifestyle of college students, most people tend to generalize the idea that all college
                students enjoy going out to party and spend time with friends, while only spending time alone when they have to study for
                their next big exam or work on a project they have been procrastinating on in one of their classes. At least, that’s how I
                viewed college students, as did most of my friends and family. So when I told my friends & family that I wouldn’t be living
                on campus, a lot of them told me that it was a bad idea to live off campus in my first year, and that I wouldn’t get the full
                “College Experience” by living off campus. My reasoning for living off campus was not just because I didn’t like the idea of
                living in a small box of a room, it was also because I didn’t want to spend the extra money that comes with living on campus,
                and also because I wanted to keep my privacy, and my ability to disconnect myself from the rest of campus.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; For me, going to the U is just my way of making sure that I can get the job that I want, and have a future that I
                am comfortable with. Even if it means sacrificing some of that genuine college experience, I have no problem with it. That means
                that I also spend more time on my own than always socializing and hanging out with other people, or making friends like most of
                the people around me are. Thing is, there are plenty of benefits to wanting to spend time by myself, and the fact that so many
                people see that point of view as an odd or negative thing, is disappointing. With that being said, I hope to explore the
                positives to spending time alone, and how it can improve the mental health and productivity of those who take more time to
                be with themselves.

            <h2><em>Benefits of Solitude</em></h2>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Although being introverted does not mean being antisocial, it does mean that the way someone reacts to social
                interaction is different from those who are extroverted. The way that they view what is considered to be social interaction
                can be different as well. As Susan Cain points out in her TED Talk from 2012, her family’s viewpoint of how they socialize and
                spend time with each other was far different than how those at her summer camp did.</p>
            <br />
            <div className="centerimg">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c0KYU2j0TM4?start=15"
                    title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Those around her viewed her idea of social interaction as weird, and she was told to be more ‘Rowdy’ and
                extroverted rather than wanting to spend time on her own. While that makes a little more sense for a kid to go and make
                friends, the fact that life for adults is so similar to this summer camp mindset, can often bring a negative association
                to acting more introverted. In the corporate world, people are often encouraged to work in teams, while having small solo
                assignments that contribute to a larger project. While there is nothing wrong with this way of doing projects, the amount
                of time that is spent having to speak with other coworkers or even the project manager can break the flow of productivity for
                those who would rather work alone, or be given more privacy to work on their assignments. As Cain goes on, she goes more in depth
                on other parts of society like this, such as schools and other, more professional places. </p>

            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Some examples of the benefits of being introverted and spending more time alone can be seen in Cain’s TED talk,
                regarding how productivity can be increased alongside creativity and one’s ability to think clearly. Another place where the
                benefits of solitude are realized can be taken from Ginny Graves’ Power of Solitude article in Health Magazine. In the article,
                Ginny points out six ways to increase one’s time to think, such as: waking up earlier to spend more time to yourself; purchasing
                an alarm clock instead of using a phone to wake up and not feel the urge to stare at a phone; and to recognize that everyone
                needs some time to themselves.</p>

            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Although it is not very hard to find time for oneself, Some ways that I feel people could find a better way to spend said
                time is by plotting out how to spend their time, a very simple and obvious answer, but most people don’t tend to do this and kind of
                go with the flow, and do whatever they feel like doing. If it were me, I would come up with a list of things I should get done first
                with my time alone, then after finishing anything I set before me, I am free to decide to do whatever without feeling guilty about
                just sitting around. It makes enjoying time alone easier, and it also makes relaxing easier. </p>

            <h1 className='project3header'><strong>Introvertedness in Active Environments</strong> </h1>
            <hr />
            <p className="dateSub"> December 8th 2022 </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; When it comes to being introverted, or preferring time alone in order to fully process
                thoughts or ideas, the thought of having to go to a class where the activities and lesson plans are
                spontaneous with participation and discussion being requested before one has the chance to fully process
                what they just learned can be uncomfortable for the introverted. With workplace environments expecting
                their employees to constantly interact and work with their fellow team members, it makes sense for schools
                to try and model their lessons and classes off of this. While this is good for those who are more extroverted,
                introverted people are often left stressed and fatigued by this way of working, and learning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; A research study on Introverts in an active classroom environment proves this to be true with those who
                are truly introverted. Richard Green, Fred Micalli, and Janet Richards conducted a study on 10 students at a community
                college on their active learning classes, and found that all of the students found the classes to be not only exhausting,
                but embarrassing and extremely stressful to them, because of their desire to perform at their expected level
                (Green et Al, 2019). Introverted people are able to handle social situations, but the amount of energy needed
                in order to fully participate in these situations is incredibly draining for them, myself included.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div className="centerimg"><img src={activeClass} alt="an active classroom at Queens university" />
                <p> <em> By Queen's university </em></p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; The students also found that the Classroom environment was also stressful for these
                students because of how the learning was being conducted. They felt as though the textbook materials
                they had been given at the beginning of the course were almost irrelevant because of how their professors
                were teaching the class, and felt as though their normal style of learning was being discouraged (Green et Al, 2019).
                I believe that this is the college’s way of encouraging students to have to attend classes and participate in these active
                discussions, rather than learning at a pace that they are most comfortable with, and are most effective for them.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p> If there was one thing that was agreed upon between the 10 participants of the study, however, it’s that they all gained
                something valuable from the class (Green et Al). I interpret this as being the skills needed in order to have a successful
                career in our new style of corporate work. As uncomfortable as it is for them, and as nice as it would be to have the
                time to work alone in a workplace environment, Introverts need to have a way to participate in these discussions,
                otherwise they will just be trampled over in their respective environments because of their way of thinking and
                living. However, the workplace should not function as a huge group of people working together all of the time
                either, and I believe that everyone in their company would benefit from not always having to communicate with each
                other, or getting time to privately work on whatever they are assigned without much interference.

            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; To back this up, the participants of the study often noted how they felt as though there wasn’t
                enough time for them to process the information they were given properly because of how the class was structured.
                In these active learning environments, students are often expected to not only learn the material, but also be able
                to almost instantly have something to say about it right after learning it (Green et Al, 2019). People who are
                introverted often need time to understand what they have learned to the fullest, and being told to come up with a
                thoughtful or educated opinion or question on new material is stressful for them, because they are not given the
                opportunity to comprehend the material.  </p>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Workplaces are the same, when new ideas for how to direct a project or system for a business are presented
                at meetings, it is often those who are more extroverted who supply the discussion with their ideas or questions over
                introverts because they have not been given enough time to process and fully understand what the pros and cons of this
                newfound idea are. If the workplace were to give their employees more time, they would be able to more freely understand
                and come up with ideas or solutions to projects and assignments, rather than having to constantly come up with solutions
                or questions right away.

            <hr />
            <p className='dateSub'> December 8th, 2022 </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; One of the main reasons that I myself enjoy time alone is because it allows me to find an
                 almost flow-like state where I can focus purely on any projects or assignments I need to get done. Writing 
                 this very post is also an example of why I enjoy time alone. Throughout this week, my time has been filled 
                 with projects, homework, and studying for other classes with others. And while this does help me better understand 
                 the material in those courses, it doesn’t help me get anything done efficiently enough to work on this one.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; I find that dedicating one’s day almost entirely to themselves, without trying to actively contact others 
                (But responding, if need be), is the best way to make sure that productivity and efficiency are at their max. This may
                 make me sound very introverted, but I do not see myself as a true introvert or an asocial person. I do believe that I 
                 have some traits of introvertedness, and I often take a longer time to understand topics, but once I do, I get a much 
                 stronger sense of understanding, and that process is faster when I am left to figure it out myself. One thing I do believe
                  I possess, however, is the ability of dispositional autonomy. Dispositional Autonomy in a person describes how they 
                  regulate their emotions and behavior, in this sense it is, for the most part, an almost automated behavior. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp;According to a study tracing the association between introvertedness, dispositional autonomy, and Solitude
                 by Thuy-vy Nguyen, Netta Weinstein, and Richard Ryan, Those with dispositional autonomy traits tend to actually desire
                  Solitude because of the benefits that come from being able to dedicate one’s time to whatever they feel necessary. 
                  While being an introvert correlates to a preference in being alone over in social situations, it doesn’t necessarily 
                  mean that a person desires to be alone (Nguyen et Al, 2018). 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Wanting to be alone doesn’t immediately make someone an introvert or someone who is asocial, 
                but those who are introverted and asocial tend to prefer the time alone, because of how they process information 
                and expend energy in social situations, much like I said in my last post. Modern College Curriculums and courses
                 tend to be taking the approach of placing its students into active environments, where everyone is instructed to
                  interact with those around them, even if it doesn’t make them comfortable because that’s what happens in the average
                   corporate job.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div className="centerimg"><img src={cubicles} alt="Workers in an office at their desks." />
            <p> From hippopx.com </p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; But corporate jobs would benefit heavily from allowing their workers to spend more time to themselves.
                 One thing that needs to be understood about Dispositional Autonomy is the Autonomy part of it, and how those with the
                  traits of someone with Dispositional Autonomy have the ability to go through life with their emotions and behaviors put 
                  in check Autonomously, which also means that their work can be done autonomously. Something that younger people or people
                   who haven’t held office jobs forget is that working in an office isn’t always cooperation between one or more employees.
                    Even if that takes up a good amount of the time in the office, there is still the need for workers to get work done 
                    independently from everyone else, and If a worker is trying to get their tasks or projects done and finds themselves
                     getting interrupted by other coworkers a lot, they aren’t going to get anything done. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; 
	            Workers need the time to get things done without their manager or their supervisor constantly bothering them by piling on more work,
                or removing them from their workspace to do something else with them or another employee. Giving those the time to work autonomously,
                without someone getting in their way, would boost the performance and productivity of the workers, just because they were left alone.

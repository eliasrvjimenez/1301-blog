 <p> &emsp; &emsp; I am not a writer. At least, not at heart. Down to the bone, I have always 
   been a more logic-oriented person, and creativity was never a strong suit of 
   mine. Sure,  I may be able to type quickly, and can type pages upon pages 
   in less than an hour, but that, to me, does not constitute a writer. Writers
   are people with the passion and creativity to create beautiful works, filled 
   to the brim with words that drive the reader to visualize whatever it is they 
   have read, and visualize it well. Writers can create worlds from nothing, 
   sprawling their ideas onto the page with ease. That is something that I cannot 
   do.</p>

   <p> &emsp; &emsp; I am a programmer. I write some of the ugliest stuff known to man, and I love it. The thing about programming is that when they say that it is a whole ‘nother language, they aren’t lying. Programming languages such as C++ and Java contain lines upon lines of code that are unreadable to the human eye, without the extensive knowledge of someone who programs. For me,  my journey to become a programmer has not always been easy. “Well, of course it wasn’t, no journey is easy”, is something that most people might say. It’s true, no journey is easy. The reason that mine was hard for me, was not that it was hard to learn. It was that it was hard to find the time and place where I could learn.

To put it plainly, my youngest sister has what is known as ‘Severe ASD’, but most
 people know it as autism. My family consists of five, six if you count our dog. 
  My mother and father met when they went here, to the University of Minnesota. 
  A few years later, when my mother was 23 and my father 27, they had me. A few 
 years after that in ‘07, they had my younger sister, and it was just the four 
 of us for quite some time. 10 years, to be exact. In 2016, my parents announced 
 to my sister and I that my mother would once again be having another child. 
  We were, of course, very excited to have another sibling. My sister was very 
 happy that she would be considered an older sister to someone after being the 
 youngest in the family for so long. For me, however, this event was not as
 happy as it should have been. I had a taste of what it was like to raise a 
 child, I had a pretty big hand in constantly looking after my slightly younger 
 sister for a long time. The responsibility that came with looking after her
 constantly was not always my favorite, and most of the time I wouldn’t plan 
 events with my friends because I felt as though it would be too hard to do 
  anything with them while having to look after my slightly younger sister.
</p>

   To top it all off, we did not live in the city that my sister and I went to
 school in. We lived in the city of Savage, a good 10 to15 mile drive everyday 
 to make it to my school, which was Olson Middle School in Bloomington. If you
 want, look up Lone Oak Drive in Savage, then chart the path to Olson Middle 
 School. The fastest it takes to get to school by car is 19 minutes (on a good
  day). Most days spent getting to school were during the winter, and there were 
 days where we wouldn’t go to school at all because of how bad the weather was. 
  That should give enough of an idea as to why it was a bit harder than usual to 
 schedule hangouts or playdates with friends. It wasn’t all bad, though. The 
 house was large, and we could easily rent it for a good price. I think it was
 only 200 more a month for a 2000+ square foot house compared to our old 
 apartment that we lived in while we were in Bloomington. Regardless, scheduling 
 time for myself was hard. And with the birth of my youngest sister, it only got
 harder.

Xiomara Vanessa Vera-Jimenez is her name. And unfortunately for her, there is 
 no way that she will ever get picked first for anything if they do activities 
 where names are organized in alphabetical order. When I first met her, she was
 beautiful. She had the facial features of my father, and the skin tone and eyes
 of my mother. And for a while, it was all going well. She did many things that
 a normal child would do, and with her birth it felt as though time flew by. 
  Seventh grade, eighth grade, and ninth grade all passed with the wind, and I 
 sometimes even mesh memories of each year together because of how quickly it 
 went by for me. My sister and I got really good at taking care of her together,
  and since my parents still had to go out without always taking Xo 
 (Xiomara’s nickname), we would have to work together to watch her. 
  Somehow, I still managed to find the time to start learning programming.  
  Although Xiomara was around to make sure there was always something on my 
 plate, I found the time.  I began to teach myself late at night, 
  since during the day I wouldn’t have the time. It wasn’t easy trying to
 learn at night, because by that time I would usually be exhausted, and my 
 retention to whatever I was learning would be low. It didn’t matter though,
  I still loved learning the stuff.

The first time I worked on my own personal project, it was for a discord bot. 
  Discord bots are used on discord servers, which can hold up to thousands of 
 people and allow them to communicate with each other. Of course, my project was
 not meant for 1000+ people, it was meant for me and my friends. I called it 
 “QueueBro”, it was meant to create queues for games that we were going to play
 once we were done with school, and it would allow us to reserve times to join
  in. I never got it to take off, but I did learn a lot about how to find
 information on how to program, and learned how to read the documentation for 
 it. I eventually dropped it when I couldn’t find enough time to actually work 
 on the project, since I was stuck on only working on it at night. It got worse 
 once COVID came around. Damn Friday the 13th, who knew that it would be such a 
 monumental event for everyone. It was Friday, March 13th, 2020. I remember this
 day vividly. The final trimester of my sophomore year was at the end of its
 first week, and for some unknown reason, school was ending 3 hours early.
  Little did I know that it would be the last time I would be in school for 
 another 2 years.

  &emsp; &emsp; For a while everything went well. I got to spend more time
 at home and so too did my parents. They couldn’t leave because of the virus,
  and that meant that I didn’t have to look after either of my sisters. For the
 first time in a while, it felt as though my schedule was clear. Man, did I take
 advantage of that. In earlier papers in this class, I mentioned that in my 9th
 grade year, I had gotten close to failing French, and that my GPA had dropped
 by a fair amount. Well, it was COVID that allowed me to recover. My parents had
 blessed me with technology. To be more exact, a computer. Yes, the IMac that I 
 used to play Roblox on every day was my greatest tool in the face of the 
 pandemic and I did everything on that computer. . I cranked out homework
 like it was nothing, spoke with my friends over Discord, and even got to play 
 games between classes (and sometimes, during them). But that isn’t all I did
 during COVID. No, one of my greatest, most intelligent friends named Joseph 
 started to help me learn how to get better at programming.

I can’t even begin how much I admire this man, but to put it plainly,
  he’s going to Stanford University on Sunday to move in (jokes on him though,
   the $60,000 of debt he is going to accrue on a yearly basis is something that
   we here at the U of M don’t have to deal with).  He and I would speak for 
 hours about his projects, and I started to learn how to write code. When I got
 to sit down and do nothing but code, I could be there for hours on end and 
 never lose focus. For me, it was the first time in a long time that I could
 sit down and do something for so long and feel fulfilled after doing it. Video
 games at this point had lost that feeling for me, so much so that they were
 beginning to feel boring. Things were going well for a good amount of the end
 of my sophomore and junior year, until summer came.

   &emsp; &emsp; It was in the summer of 2020 that so many things changed. 
  First, my family and I moved out of Savage (thank god),  and back into the
 east side of Bloomington, where I still live to this day. Second, the sophomore
 year for me had ended well, I got straight A’s to finish off the year, and my 
 younger sister was starting her final year of middle school. Third, my parents
 had managed to get an appointment with Xo’s provider (healthcare worker’s term
  for doctor, both of my parents work in healthcare), and she was officially
 diagnosed with autism. For me and my family, this didn’t come as much of a 
 surprise. At this point Xo had been around for three years and still couldn’t
 talk; she couldn’t look people in the eye and she also hyper focused on whatever she was doing, so much so that she would get unbelievably frustrated if you
 were to try and take her away from it. With her diagnosis, however, came more 
 challenges. Since having ASD meant that she could fall behind in school, my
 parents decided that we should get her started on the therapies used to allow
 children with autism to develop ‘normal’ social skills, which required her to
 be taken to her therapies by someone in the family. 
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p> &emsp; &emsp; My junior year went similarly to my sophomore year. I once 
 again got almost all A’s, and before I knew it, it was summer again. It isn’t 
 until the end of my 2021 summer that things start to get a little more unstable.
  I had passed my driver’s permit exam in the year 2019, but because I lived in 
  Savage and my parents were busy with Xo (alongside COVID), I got little to no 
 driving practice for 2 years. Until the summer of 2021, when I essentially
 speed-ran my driving hours in order to have a driver’s license by the time
 school started. After successfully doing just that, I then moved on to get a 
 job. Now, with a driver’s license and a job to not only cover gas but also 
 all of the payments on my car, my parents told me that I now had to drop off 
 my younger sister every day to school. This is not so bad that it caused me
 numerous amounts of stress. No, it was that my parents also wanted me to
 consistently fill in for them by picking up Xo from her therapies while 
 school was still going on.

     Sure, my schedule consisted of mainly online classes and only one in 
  person, but I still had 6 classes. With that distraction being created, along 
 with my working directly after school and on weekends 5 days a week, my time to
 fit homework and programming practice lessened. Miraculously, I still managed 
 to find time to do both. I got better at programming, and with my car that I 
 practically own, I was able to go essentially anywhere, and do whatever I 
 wanted. With the ability to do whatever I wanted, I chose to spend more time 
 with Joseph, along with more of my friends who also were into computer science.
  I learned how to truly develop websites from scratch, and improved my 
 programming skills and typing skills over time. I worked on some more projects,
  and finally got into more programming oriented classes.

     Now that I’m at the  University of Minnesota, I no longer have to worry as
 much about working and taking care of my family.  I still work, but at a 
 different company, and have had it set up in a way that allows me to work 
 only on weekends and Fridays. Every other day of the week for me now is free, 
  and since I am in college, I can take classes that actually relate to my
 passion. In the end, I am not a writer, I am a programmer. I try my best to 
 get better at my passion with what time I am given to do so, whether it be 
 between classes and my time dedicated to my family, or my work and social life,
  I still try to program. I must admit, however, that even though I am not a
 writer, I sure do love to write. Even if I’m not as creative as other people
 out there, I find it to be a great way to express myself and to find a more 
 clear way to get my ideas onto the screen, whether that be through words and 
 sentences, or through curly brackets and semicolons.

 <p>I am not a writer. At least, not at heart. Down to the bone, I have always 
   been a more logic-oriented person, and creativity was never a strong suit of 
   mine. Sure,  I may be able to type quickly, and can type pages upon pages 
   in less than an hour, but that, to me, does not constitute a writer. Writers
   are people with the passion and creativity to create beautiful works, filled 
   to the brim with words that drive the reader to visualize whatever it is they 
   have read, and visualize it well. Writers can create worlds from nothing, 
   sprawling their ideas onto the page with ease. That is something that I cannot 
   do.</p>

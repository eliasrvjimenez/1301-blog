 <p> &emsp; &emsp; I am not a writer. At least, not at heart. Down to the bone, I have always 
   been a more logic-oriented person, and creativity was never a strong suit of 
   mine. Sure,  I may be able to type quickly, and can type pages upon pages 
   in less than an hour, but that, to me, does not constitute a writer. Writers
   are people with the passion and creativity to create beautiful works, filled 
   to the brim with words that drive the reader to visualize whatever it is they 
   have read, and visualize it well. Writers can create worlds from nothing, 
   sprawling their ideas onto the page with ease. That is something that I cannot 
   do.</p>

   <p> &emsp; &emsp; I am a programmer. I write some of the ugliest stuff known to man, and I love it. The thing about programming is that when they say that it is a whole ‘nother language, they aren’t lying. Programming languages such as C++ and Java contain lines upon lines of code that are unreadable to the human eye, without the extensive knowledge of someone who programs. For me,  my journey to become a programmer has not always been easy. “Well, of course it wasn’t, no journey is easy”, is something that most people might say. It’s true, no journey is easy. The reason that mine was hard for me, was not that it was hard to learn. It was that it was hard to find the time and place where I could learn.

   <p> &emsp; &emsp;To put it plainly, my youngest sister has what is 
 known as ‘Severe ASD’, but most people know it as autism. My family 
 consists of five, six if you count our dog. My mother and father met 
 when they went here, to the University of Minnesota. A few years later,
  when my mother was 23 and my father 27, they had me. A few years after 
 that in ‘07, they had my younger sister, and it was just the four of us
 for quite some time. 10 years, to be exact. In 2016, my parents 
 announced to my sister and I that my mother would once again be having 
 another child. We were, of course, very excited to have another 
 sibling. My sister was very happy that she would be considered an older sister to 
 someone after being considered the youngest in the family for so long. 
  For me, however, this event was not as happy as it should have been. I
 had a taste of what it was like to raise a child, I had a pretty big 
 hand in constantly looking after my slightly younger sister for a long 
 time. The responsibility that came with looking after her constantly 
 was not always my favorite, and most of the time I wouldn’t plan events 
 with my friends because I felt as though it would be too hard to do 
  anything with them while having to look after my slightly younger 
 sister. To top it all off, we did not live in the city that my sister 
 and I went to school in. We lived in the city of Savage, a good 10 
 to-15 mile drive everyday to make it to my school, which was Olson 
 Middle School in Bloomington. If you want, look up Lone Ooak Ddrive 
  in Savage, then chart the path to Olson Middle School. The fastest 
 it takes to get to school by car is 19 minutes, (on a good day). Most 
 days spent getting to school were during the winter, and there were 
 days where we wouldn’t go to school at all because of how bad the 
 weather was. That should give enough of an idea as to why it was a bit 
 harder than usual to schedule hangouts or playdates with friends. It 
 wasn’t all bad, though. The house was large, and we could easily rent 
 it for a good price. I think it was only 200 more a month for a 2000+ 
  square foot house compared to our old apartment that we lived in while
 we were in Bloomington. Regardless, scheduling time for myself was 
 hard. And with the birth of my youngest sister, it only got harder.
</p>
  <br />
  <p> &emsp; &emsp; Xiomara Vanessa Vera-Jimenez is her name. And 
 unfortunately for her, there is no way that she will ever get picked
 first for anything if they do activities where names are organized in 
  alphabetical order. When I first met her, she was beautiful. She had 
 the facial features of my father, and the skin tone and eyes of my 
 mother. And for a while, it was all going well. She did many things 
 that a normal child would do, and with her birth it felt as though time 
 flew by. Seventh grade, eighth grade, and ninth grade all passed with 
 the wind, and I sometimes even mesh memories of each year together 
 because of how quickly it went by for me. My sister and I got really 
 good at taking care of her together, and since my parents still had to
 go out without always taking Xo (Xiomara’s nickname), we would have to
 work together to watch her. I must admit, we did bicker with each other. I had developed conventions of taking care of my sisters after being 
 tasked with babysitting my younger sister for 6-7 years. Since she was
 new to the game, she had other ways of doing things. Eventually,
  we did manage to find a middle ground, and trust me when I say
 that this made things far easier than before. We would often trade off
 when looking after Xo, one person would go work on chores, homework, 
  etc., while the other watched her. Once the other was done, we would
 switch. For another year or so, this would go well. Until the day of 
 Friday, March 13th, 2020. I remember this day vividly. The final
 trimester of my sophomore year was at the end of its first week, and 
 for some unknown reason, school was ending 3 hours early. None of us
 knew why until later. My family and I went to a place called the
 Mediterranean Cafe, the doors of the place open to this expansive room, 
  the ceiling at least two, three stories from the ground, with windows
 lining the front and back of the huge room. The restaurant was in the 
 style of a buffet most days. The importance of this place, however, was
 not the food. No, it was the fact that the other two walls, the left 
 and right ones, were lined with TVs. for a good 20-30 minutes from the 
 time we arrived. Everything was normal. Only one of the TVs in the
 corner was playing Tim Walz’ address to the state. While the rest of my 
 family paid attention either to their food or Xo, I watched that TV.
  Once he began to speak of school closures, the staff of the building 
 took notice and quickly switched the rest of the TVs to the same 
 channel.  Damn Friday the 13th, who knew that it would be such a
 monumental event, for everyone.

  <p> &emsp; &emsp; I’m not trying to downplay COVID, but for me the
 event was pretty great. For a while everything went well. I got to
 spend more time at home and so too did my parents. They couldn’t leave
 because of the virus, and that meant that I didn’t have to look after 
 either of my sisters. For the first time in a while, it felt as though
 my schedule was clear. Man, did I take advantage of that. In earlier
 papers in this class, I mentioned that in my 9th grade year, I had
 gotten close to failing French, and that my GPA had dropped by a fair
 amount. Well, it was COVID that allowed me to recover. My parents had
 blessed me with technology. To be more exact, a computer. Yes, the IMac
 that I used to play Roblox on every day was my greatest tool in the 
 face of the pandemic, and I did everything on that computer. I cranked
 out homework like it was nothing, spoke with my friends over Discord,
  and even got to play games between classes (and sometimes, during them).
  But that isn’t all I did during COVID. No, one of my greatest, most 
 intelligent friends named Joseph got to finally start learning how to 
 program. I can’t even begin how much I admire this man, but to put it 
 plainly, he’s going to Stanford University on sunday to move in 
  (jokes on him though, the $60,000 of debt he is going to accrue on a 
   yearly basis is something that we here at the U of M don’t have to 
   deal with).  He and I would speak for hours about his projects, and 
 I started to learn how to write code.  When I got to sit down and do
  nothing but code, I could be there for hours on end, and never 
 lose focus. For me, it was the first time in a long time that I could 
 sit down and do something for so long and feel fulfilled after doing 
 it. Video games at this point had lost that feeling for me, so much so
 that they were beginning to feel boring. Things were going well for a 
 good amount of the end of my senior year, until summer came.

  &emsp; &emsp; It was in the summer of 2020 that so many things changed.
  First, my family and I moved out of Savage (thank god),  and back into 
 the east side of Bloomington, where I still live to this day. Second, 
  the sophomore year for me had ended well, I got straight A’s to finish
 off the year, and my younger sister was starting her final year of
 middle school. Third, my parents had managed to get an appointment with 
 Xo’s provider (healthcare worker’s term for doctor, both of my parents 
  work in healthcare), and she was officially diagnosed with autism. For
 me and my family, this didn’t come as much of a surprise. At this point
 Xo had been around for three years and still couldn’t talk; she couldn’t
 look people in the eye and she also hyper focused on whatever she was 
 doing, so much so that she would get unbelievably frustrated if you were
 to try and take her away from it. With her diagnosis, however, came 
 more challenges. Since having ASD meant that she could fall behind in
  school, my parents decided that we should get her started on the 
 therapies used to allow children with autism to develop ‘normal’ social
 skills, which required her to be taken to her therapies by someone in 
  the family.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  &emsp; &emsp; For the rest of COVID, we did most of them online, 
  I was still working on my personal projects and doing well in school. 
  It isn’t until the end of my 2021 summer that things start to get a 
 little more unstable. I had passed my driver’s permit exam in the year
 2019, but because I lived in Savage and my parents were busy with Xo 
 (alongside COVID), I got little to no driving practice for 2 years. 
  Until the summer of 2021, when I essentially speed-ran my driving 
 hours in order to have a driver’s license by the time school started.
  After successfully doing just that, I then moved on to get a job.
  Now, with a driver’s license and a job to not only cover gas but 
 also all of the payments on my car, my parents told me that I now had
 to drop off my younger sister every day to school. This is not so bad
 that it caused me numerous amounts of stress. No, it was that my 
 parents also wanted me to consistently fill in for them by picking 
 up Xo from her therapies while school was still going on. This would
 usually happen right after my first and last class of the day,
  calculus. Sure my schedule consisted of mainly online classes and 
 only one in person, but I still had 6 classes. With that distraction
 being created, along with my working directly after school and on 
 weekends 5 days a week, my time to fit homework and programming 
 practice lessened. Miraculously, I still managed to find time to do
  both. I got better at programming, and with my car that I
 practically own, I was able to go essentially anywhere, and do whatever
 I wanted. With the ability to do whatever I wanted, I chose to spend 
 more time with Joseph, along with more of my friends who also were into
 computer science. I learned how to truly develop websites from scratch,
  and improved my programming skills and typing skills over time.

  <p>
   &emsp; &emsp; The thing about having a sister with autism is that she
 needs to be almost constantly monitored by someone, and that someone 
 will want help from whoever else is around. This means that most of my
 free time has to be spent outside of my house or it occurs during
 nighttime. At the time, there were two problems with this. One, my 
 younger sister who was in the same school as me didn’t have any other
 way home, so if I were to leave school at some point during the day 
 I would eventually need to return. Two, I work in the evenings, there 
 is no free time to do whatever you want at home when you take on school
 and work at the same time, and are gone for a good 14 hours of the day.
  It is for this reason that doing anything that I consider remotely 
 productive at home. Now, with my being at the University of Minnesota,
  I no longer have to do either of those things, at least not as much. 
  I still work, but at a different company, and have had it set up in a 
 way that allows me to work only on weekends and Fridays. Every other 
 day of the week for me now is free, and since I am in college, I can 
 take classes that actually relate to my passion. In the end, I am not a
 writer, I am a programmer. I try my best to get better at my passion 
 with what time I am given to do so, whether it be between classes and
 my time dedicated to my family, or my work and social life, I still try
 to program. I must admit, however, that even though I am not a writer, 
  I sure do love to write, especially when I get to vent about things I
 normally don’t get a chance to talk about because of said things. In
 hindsight, writing is not only a thing for people who are incredibly
 creative or dedicated to their craft, it can also be for people who
 have something they want to say.

 <p> &emsp; &emsp; I am not a writer. At least, not at heart. Down to the bone, I have always 
   been a more logic-oriented person, and creativity was never a strong suit of 
   mine. Sure,  I may be able to type quickly, and can type pages upon pages 
   in less than an hour, but that, to me, does not constitute a writer. Writers
   are people with the passion and creativity to create beautiful works, filled 
   to the brim with words that drive the reader to visualize whatever it is they 
   have read, and visualize it well. Writers can create worlds from nothing, 
   sprawling their ideas onto the page with ease. That is something that I cannot 
   do.</p>

   <p> &emsp; &emsp; I am a programmer. I write some of the ugliest stuff known to man, and I love it. The thing about programming is that when they say that it is a whole ‘nother language, they aren’t lying. Programming languages such as C++ and Java contain lines upon lines of code that are unreadable to the human eye, without the extensive knowledge of someone who programs. For me,  my journey to become a programmer has not always been easy. “Well, of course it wasn’t, no journey is easy”, is something that most people might say. It’s true, no journey is easy. The reason that mine was hard for me, was not that it was hard to learn. It was that it was hard to find the time and place where I could learn.

To put it plainly, my youngest sister has what is known as ‘Severe ASD’, but most
 people know it as autism. My family consists of five, six if you count our dog. 
  My mother and father met when they went here, to the University of Minnesota. 
  A few years later, when my mother was 23 and my father 27, they had me. A few 
 years after that in ‘07, they had my younger sister, and it was just the four 
 of us for quite some time. 10 years, to be exact. In 2016, my parents announced 
 to my sister and I that my mother would once again be having another child. 
  We were, of course, very excited to have another sibling. My sister was very 
 happy that she would be considered an older sister to someone after being the 
 youngest in the family for so long. For me, however, this event was not as
 happy as it should have been. I had a taste of what it was like to raise a 
 child, I had a pretty big hand in constantly looking after my slightly younger 
 sister for a long time. The responsibility that came with looking after her
 constantly was not always my favorite, and most of the time I wouldn’t plan 
 events with my friends because I felt as though it would be too hard to do 
  anything with them while having to look after my slightly younger sister.
</p>
<br />
  <p> &emsp; &emsp; 
   To top it all off, we did not live in the city that my sister and I went to
 school in. We lived in the city of Savage, a good 10 to15 mile drive everyday 
 to make it to my school, which was Olson Middle School in Bloomington. If you
 want, look up Lone Oak Drive in Savage, then chart the path to Olson Middle 
 School. The fastest it takes to get to school by car is 19 minutes (on a good
  day). Most days spent getting to school were during the winter, and there were 
 days where we wouldn’t go to school at all because of how bad the weather was. 
  That should give enough of an idea as to why it was a bit harder than usual to 
 schedule hangouts or playdates with friends. It wasn’t all bad, though. The 
 house was large, and we could easily rent it for a good price. I think it was
 only 200 more a month for a 2000+ square foot house compared to our old 
 apartment that we lived in while we were in Bloomington. Regardless, scheduling 
 time for myself was hard. And with the birth of my youngest sister, it only got
 harder.

Xiomara Vanessa Vera-Jimenez is her name. And unfortunately for her, there is 
 no way that she will ever get picked first for anything if they do activities 
 where names are organized in alphabetical order. When I first met her, she was
 beautiful. She had the facial features of my father, and the skin tone and eyes
 of my mother. And for a while, it was all going well. She did many things that
 a normal child would do, and with her birth it felt as though time flew by. 
  Seventh grade, eighth grade, and ninth grade all passed with the wind, and I 
 sometimes even mesh memories of each year together because of how quickly it 
 went by for me. My sister and I got really good at taking care of her together,
  and since my parents still had to go out without always taking Xo 
 (Xiomara’s nickname), we would have to work together to watch her. 
  Somehow, I still managed to find the time to start learning programming.  
  Although Xiomara was around to make sure there was always something on my 
 plate, I found the time.  I began to teach myself late at night, 
  since during the day I wouldn’t have the time. It wasn’t easy trying to
 learn at night, because by that time I would usually be exhausted, and my 
 retention to whatever I was learning would be low. It didn’t matter though,
  I still loved learning the stuff.
 </p>
  <br />
  <p> &emsp; &emsp; 
The first time I worked on my own personal project, it was for a discord bot. 
  Discord bots are used on discord servers, which can hold up to thousands of 
 people and allow them to communicate with each other. Of course, my project was
 not meant for 1000+ people, it was meant for me and my friends. I called it 
 “QueueBro”, it was meant to create queues for games that we were going to play
 once we were done with school, and it would allow us to reserve times to join
  in. I never got it to take off, but I did learn a lot about how to find
 information on how to program, and learned how to read the documentation for 
 it. I eventually dropped it when I couldn’t find enough time to actually work 
 on the project, since I was stuck on only working on it at night. It got worse 
 once COVID came around. Damn Friday the 13th, who knew that it would be such a 
 monumental event for everyone. It was Friday, March 13th, 2020. I remember this
 day vividly. The final trimester of my sophomore year was at the end of its
 first week, and for some unknown reason, school was ending 3 hours early.
  Little did I know that it would be the last time I would be in school for 
 another 2 years. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  &emsp; &emsp; For a while everything went well. I got to spend more time
 at home and so too did my parents. They couldn’t leave because of the virus,
  and that meant that I didn’t have to look after either of my sisters. For the
 first time in a while, it felt as though my schedule was clear. Man, did I take
 advantage of that. In earlier papers in this class, I mentioned that in my 9th
 grade year, I had gotten close to failing French, and that my GPA had dropped
 by a fair amount. Well, it was COVID that allowed me to recover. My parents had
 blessed me with technology. To be more exact, a computer. Yes, the IMac that I 
 used to play Roblox on every day was my greatest tool in the face of the 
 pandemic and I did everything on that computer. . I cranked out homework
 like it was nothing, spoke with my friends over Discord, and even got to play 
 games between classes (and sometimes, during them). But that isn’t all I did
 during COVID. No, one of my greatest, most intelligent friends named Joseph 
 started to help me learn how to get better at programming.   
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  &emsp; &emsp; 
I can’t even begin how much I admire this man, but to put it plainly,
  he’s going to Stanford University on Sunday to move in (jokes on him though,
   the $60,000 of debt he is going to accrue on a yearly basis is something that
   we here at the U of M don’t have to deal with).  He and I would speak for 
 hours about his projects, and I started to learn how to write code. When I got
 to sit down and do nothing but code, I could be there for hours on end and 
 never lose focus. For me, it was the first time in a long time that I could
 sit down and do something for so long and feel fulfilled after doing it. Video
 games at this point had lost that feeling for me, so much so that they were
 beginning to feel boring. Things were going well for a good amount of the end
 of my sophomore and junior year, until summer came.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <br />
  <p>
   &emsp; &emsp; It was in the summer of 2020 that so many things changed. 
  First, my family and I moved out of Savage (thank god),  and back into the
 east side of Bloomington, where I still live to this day. Second, the sophomore
 year for me had ended well, I got straight A’s to finish off the year, and my 
 younger sister was starting her final year of middle school. Third, my parents
 had managed to get an appointment with Xo’s provider (healthcare worker’s term
  for doctor, both of my parents work in healthcare), and she was officially
 diagnosed with autism. For me and my family, this didn’t come as much of a 
 surprise. At this point Xo had been around for three years and still couldn’t
 talk; she couldn’t look people in the eye and she also hyper focused on whatever she was doing, so much so that she would get unbelievably frustrated if you
 were to try and take her away from it. With her diagnosis, however, came more 
 challenges. Since having ASD meant that she could fall behind in school, my
 parents decided that we should get her started on the therapies used to allow
 children with autism to develop ‘normal’ social skills, which required her to
 be taken to her therapies by someone in the family. 
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p> &emsp; &emsp; My junior year went similarly to my sophomore year. I once 
 again got almost all A’s, and before I knew it, it was summer again. It isn’t 
 until the end of my 2021 summer that things start to get a little more unstable.
  I had passed my driver’s permit exam in the year 2019, but because I lived in 
  Savage and my parents were busy with Xo (alongside COVID), I got little to no 
 driving practice for 2 years. Until the summer of 2021, when I essentially
 speed-ran my driving hours in order to have a driver’s license by the time
 school started. After successfully doing just that, I then moved on to get a 
 job. Now, with a driver’s license and a job to not only cover gas but also 
 all of the payments on my car, my parents told me that I now had to drop off 
 my younger sister every day to school. This is not so bad that it caused me
 numerous amounts of stress. No, it was that my parents also wanted me to
 consistently fill in for them by picking up Xo from her therapies while 
 school was still going on.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> &emsp; &emsp;
     Sure, my schedule consisted of mainly online classes and only one in 
  person, but I still had 6 classes. With that distraction being created, along 
 with my working directly after school and on weekends 5 days a week, my time to
 fit homework and programming practice lessened. Miraculously, I still managed 
 to find time to do both. I got better at programming, and with my car that I 
 practically own, I was able to go essentially anywhere, and do whatever I 
 wanted. With the ability to do whatever I wanted, I chose to spend more time 
 with Joseph, along with more of my friends who also were into computer science.
  I learned how to truly develop websites from scratch, and improved my 
 programming skills and typing skills over time. I worked on some more projects,
  and finally got into more programming oriented classes.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <br />
  <p> &emsp; &emsp;
     Now that I’m at the  University of Minnesota, I no longer have to worry as
 much about working and taking care of my family.  I still work, but at a 
 different company, and have had it set up in a way that allows me to work 
 only on weekends and Fridays. Every other day of the week for me now is free, 
  and since I am in college, I can take classes that actually relate to my
 passion. In the end, I am not a writer, I am a programmer. I try my best to 
 get better at my passion with what time I am given to do so, whether it be 
 between classes and my time dedicated to my family, or my work and social life,
  I still try to program. I must admit, however, that even though I am not a
 writer, I sure do love to write. Even if I’m not as creative as other people
 out there, I find it to be a great way to express myself and to find a more 
 clear way to get my ideas onto the screen, whether that be through words and 
 sentences, or through curly brackets and semicolons.

      <p>&emsp; &emsp;
      In an era that revolves around the use of technology and media to connect everyone to the rest of the world, there
      are those who abuse their voices on the internet and push their thoughts and ideologies that if blindly followed by 
      others, can be incredibly dangerous and to society as a whole. Most of this is done through the means of writing,
      and it’s power to spread ideas and information, no matter if it is fact or fiction, to a greater audience of people.
      But what gives someone the status, or title, of writer? What allows them to be seen as a 
      writer, someone who has a platform? Is it someone who went through years of rigorous work and thousands of 
      dollars in order to get a piece of paper that states they are a writer?  
      Or is it something else, something like a desire to be seen and heard by others, 
      to be given a voice in a world filled with voices?
</p>
<br/>
<h2> <em> To Start, </em> </h2>
<br/>
<p>&emsp; &emsp;
To answer that question, the question of how writers are supposed to write appears first. Different dialects and 
languages are often looked down upon when it comes to writing because of how their language uses rhetorical devices 
and grammatical rules. Stanley Fish, a distinguished author of many articles and a former professor of law at Florida 
International University, and is a dean emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at University of 
Illinois Chicago, wrote an opinion for the New York Times back in 2009, where he criticizes secondary schools for 
failing to properly teach “Standard” english to their students, and forcing post-secondary schools and instructors to 
clean up their mistakes. In his article, Fish (2009) says, 

<div className="centeredQuote">
<p><em>“And if students infected with the facile egalitarianism of soft multiculturalism declare, “I have a right to my own 
language,” reply, “Yes , you do, and I am not here to take that language from you; I’m here to teach you another 
one.” (Who could object to learning a second language?) And then get on with it” (p. 3). </em></p></div>

According to Fish, to even have the right to call yourself a real writer, you need to be a master of all of the 
formatting and grammatical rules of standard english, and that if you know any other dialect or forms of writing that 
are not the standard, then you should learn standard english and stop using the other form. What Fish doesn’t 
realize, however, is that doing this alienates a massive group of people from being able to join in the conversation 
and intake the cesspool of information and ideas being spread around the world because they are not at a level of 
education where they would be able to understand what people like Fish are even talking about when they read their 
writing. It’s because there are people like Fish, who believe that you need to be on their level of standard English 
knowledge and comprehension in order to hold the same status as them, and to even have a voice in the world of 
writing. It’s because of views and ideas like this that allow people like Donald Trump to win presidency and control 
over a world superpower because he has the knowledge to speak like a normal person to the people.

</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2><em> "Standard English"</em> in professional fields </h2>
<br/>
<p>&emsp; &emsp;
When people in politics often speak and write a lot like Fish does in order to sound more “Professional” and 
“Educated”, those that politicians are supposed to be serving are often left confused. They are left wondering what 
these people in power are even doing to the country that they live in, because of one simple truth, not everyone is 
a College graduate, and not everyone has full mastery over the rules and laws of standard English. This is what
allows someone with no political experience, Donald Trump, to be exact, to run for the executive office of the 
United states and win against a bunch of so-called professional and experienced politicians. Call Trump whatever you
want, a racist, rapist, pedo, bigot who knows nothing about how to run a country. Most of that is true, but if there
was one thing that needs to be acknowledged about the man, it’s his ability to appeal to a wider audience than any of 
those politicians that ran against him.  The way he did that was simple, really. He spoke like a normal person. Not 
even, to be honest, he sounded more like a child than anything. In the end, it didn’t matter. He won because people 
were able to understand what he was saying and they were sick and tired of feeling like a bunch of morons because 
they did not have the opportunity to pursue higher education. Donald Trump isn’t the only example of this type of 
influence either, many news sources like “The Hill” and “Fox News” also have professional writers writing in simpler, 
more understandable ways that millions of people listen to and read daily, whether or not the information is true or 
false.

<br/>
<h2><em>Code-Meshing & Writing </em></h2>
<br/>
<p> &emsp; &emsp;
So, for me at least, Fish’s view on what makes someone a writer is not correct. I am not alone in thinking that way 
either, there are plenty of examples of people Criticizing Stanley Fish’s work and views on writing, most notably to 
me is Vershawn Ashanti Young, another author and co-author of a handful of books and articles, as well as a Scholar 
and researcher of African American Studies, more specifically the gender, performance, and language parts of it. In 
Young’s(2011) chapter of <em>Writing Centers and the New Racism: A Call for Sustainable Dialogue and Change</em>, called 
"SHOULD WRITERS USE THEY OWN ENGLISH?" Young uses the same quote as I, alongside several other quotes from the same 
article to break down Fish’s idea. The main thing that interested me about Young’s piece in this book, is his idea 
revolving around what can be referred to as Code Meshing, which is the use of several different languages and 
dialects’ grammatical and rhetorical devices in order to better communicate and express one’s ideas through speaking 
and writing.  Furthermore, Young goes on to emphasize the power of code meshing and even uses some examples from 
politicians on twitter to show what Code meshing can do ( p. 67-70). The thing about code meshing is that it goes 
completely against the idea of needing to have a strong knowledge of the English language and standard English format 
for writing. 
</p>
<br/>
<p> &emsp; &emsp;
There are plenty of writers out there that use code meshing throughout their writing, such as Young and Amy Tan, a 
distinguished author of several books and articles as well as a holder of a Masters Degree in English and Linguistics 
from San Jose State University. Tan, although having her masters, does not write in the style that people like Fish 
would. Instead, she chooses to use what Young called Code-Meshing to write her stories. In her Article for The 
Threepenny Review Mother Tongue, Tan describes why she does this, and says that she uses the English that she spoke 
to her mother with because she wants to capture her mother’s  
<div className="centeredQuote"><p>&emsp;“... intent, her passion, her imagery, the rhythm of her speech, and the nature 
  of her thoughts”(Tan, 1990, p. 8). </p></div>
  Tan uses her mother’s style of speaking to influence her own ways of speaking and writing, because she prefers the 
abilities and tools she gains by using her mother’s version of english to express herself and provide imagery in her 
way of speaking and writing. The thing is, Both Amy Tan and Stanley Fish are what people consider to be “Writers”, 
even though their respective  styles of writing are vastly different from one another. This is most likely because of 
the audience that they are targeting. While Stanley’s form of writing favors those who are also high-level scholars, 
Tan’s writing style tends to be more in the favor of all readers.  
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2><em>What Qualifies a Writer?</em></h2>
<br/>
<p>&emsp; &emsp;
All that has done is add to the already asked question, not answer it. While Stanley Fish and Amy Tan are what most 
consider to be “Qualified” writers, what allows them to be? I believe that I am getting close to the answer, and I 
may have just found it. American Poet Ocean Voung is the recipient of several awards for their poems and pieces they 
have written, but it was not always so easy for them. See, Ocean, being an immigrant from Vietnam, was not the best 
at English in their early years, according to their article “Surrendering” in The New Yorker. In this article, Voung 
describes how they were in an E.S.L class for their early years of teaching. And describes their experience with 
writing a poem for the first time. Their teacher, after receiving their work, yells at them for plagiarizing even 
though they did nothing of the sort, simply because the teacher assumed that because Voung had to take E.S.L classes 
that they were not capable of writing their own poem (Voung, 2016). The teacher made an assumption that Voung was not 
capable of writing poetry because of their background and knowledge of standard English, and called them a plagiarist 
because of it. Although, after reading some pieces of the poetry Voung put in their article, it looks like something 
I have never seen or heard before, so I would assume that it is original. To me, it sounds like the teacher saw 
Voung's work as someone else's because of what they believe to be the capabilities of someone who does not know how 
to read and write in standard English. Fish also believes that people cannot be considered proficient in English if 
they do not know all of the structures and rules of Standard English, and clearly, using Voung’s and Tan’s pieces as 
an Example, I have shown that Fish’s idea is not true. But if there aren’t limits on how people write, then what are 
the limits on what makes people writers.  
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><em>To Conclude...</em></h3>
<br/>
<p>&emsp; &emsp;
This is where I come to the conclusion that there are no rules to what makes someone a writer, and there is no solid 
definition of what gives someone the title of writer. In the end, a Writer can truly be anybody that knows how to use 
a pencil or computer to print letters onto either a piece of paper or a screen,  and it is up to whoever reads it to 
decide whether or not the person who wrote that piece can be called a writer. As long as someone considers their work 
to be that of a writer, then they are a writer. People like Fish and Trump can go around saying that those who don’t 
use standard English are not Good writers or Professional writers, but that doesn’t change the fact that as long as 
they have a way of communicating through printing words onto something for someone else to see, then they are a 
writer.
